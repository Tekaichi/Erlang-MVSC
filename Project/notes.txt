Assumptions
• FIFO channels
• Each process has an unique id
• Process ids are totally ordered
• When designing an election algorithm one may postulate that the process with the largest (smallest) id must win the election
• Overall ideia: The algorithm computes the largest ID and informs all other processes, then that process becomes the leader

(Some) Keypoints:
Gen Server -> Supervisor -> Starts all nodes sequentally
State Machine
Id nodes are sequential

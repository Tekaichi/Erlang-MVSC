Assumptions
• FIFO channels
• Each process has an unique id
• Process ids are totally ordered
• When designing an election algorithm one may postulate that the process with the largest (smallest) id must win the election
• Overall ideia: The algorithm computes the largest ID and informs all other processes, then that process becomes the leader


Failing tests: 

 [-1,-3,1,4,11,6,12,8,9,10]
 [2,1,3,4,11,6,12,8,9,10]

 It seems that when the second ID is lower than the 1 the result is inaccurate..

 However, this is ok

 [2,1,3,4,13,6,12,8,9,10]
